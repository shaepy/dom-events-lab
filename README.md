# Description
This is a lab assignment for General Assembly to create a functioning calculator.

The calculator takes two multi-digit numbers and performs an operation between them:
* When trying to divide by 0, it will return a message saying to "try again".
* The resulted total number of each operation can be operated on again without needing to type it again.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## User Stories (completed)
* As a user, I want to be able to select numbers so that I can perform operations with them.
* As a user, I want to be able to add two numbers together.
* As a user, I want to be able to subtract one number from another.
* As a user, I want to be able to multiply two numbers together.
* As a user, I want to be able to divide one number by another.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the output of the mathematical operation.
* As a user, I want to be able to clear all operations and start from 0.

## Level Up Challenges (Completed)
1. Improve the code to accept multi-digit numbers for the calculations
2. Have the recent total become the first number to operate again
