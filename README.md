## Deployment Link

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Edge Cases Covered
* When trying to divide by 0, it will return a message saying to "try again" until another button is selected.
* When using the equals(=) sign before a second number is selected, it will keep the first number until an operator and second number is selected, or cleared.

## Level Up Features
1. The calculator accepts multi-digit numbers
2. The recent total is always saved so it can be used as the first number in the next operation
3. Display the entire operation in the same display until the total

## User Stories (MVP)
* As a user, I want to be able to select numbers so that I can perform operations with them.
* As a user, I want to be able to add two numbers together.
* As a user, I want to be able to subtract one number from another.
* As a user, I want to be able to multiply two numbers together.
* As a user, I want to be able to divide one number by another.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the output of the mathematical operation.
* As a user, I want to be able to clear all operations and start from 0.

## Further Improvements (In progress..)
2. Accept decimals
